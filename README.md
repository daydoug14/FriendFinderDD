# FriendFinderDD
We built a compatibility-based "FriendFinder" application -- basically a dating app. This full-stack site will take in results from the users' surveys, then compare their answers with those from other users. The app will then display the name and picture of the user with the best overall match. This site is specifically a "Dog Friend Finder."

We will used Express to handle routing. Make sure you deploy your app to Heroku so other users can fill it out.



### Submission on BCS

* Please submit both the deployed Github.io link to your homework AND the link to the Github Repository!

### Instructions

1. Your survey should have 10 questions of your choosing. Each answer should be on a scale of 1 to 5 based on how much the user agrees or disagrees with a question.

2. Your `server.js` file should require the basic npm packages we've used in class: `express`, `body-parser` and `path`.

3. Your `htmlRoutes.js` file should include two routes:

   * A GET Route to `/survey` which should display the survey page.
   * A default, catch-all route that leads to `home.html` which displays the home page.
